## Description & Motivation

I like to consume Reddit, but ideally in a low-volume amount. It is way too easy to open Reddit and start going down the rabbit hole.

I like Dev.to as well, but it requires too much sifting through.

### Problem 1

One could easily turn any subreddit into an RSS feed by appending `/.rss` to the URL. For whatever reason, some of the feeds I'd like to follow were not updated in the last year or more!

### Problem 2

The Dev.to RSS feed at [`https://dev.to/feed`](https://dev.to/feed) returns way too much content. Really cluttering one's RSS reader.

### My Solution

Generate my own RSS feed!

## How It Works

Deployed on a bare metal home server, the `fetcher` service gets the top 30 posts (from the past month) from each of the subreddits in a config file, and the top 30 posts from the last 30 days from Dev.to, both twice per day.

The `backend` service will return the generated feed as a valid RSS that anybody can subscribe through their preferred RSS reader. E.g., Feedly.

In the future, I'd like to make it possible for visitors to create a their own personalized feeds (with a unique URL to subscribe to). _Keyword: future_.
